Abstract out "view" to enable switch to SFML

Need to implement code to deal with backlash

Read thread pitch data from config file

Remove all unicorn initialisation

Just have two "main" memories for target and return with hotkeys which
just go to these two ('C'ut and 'R'eturn, perhaps?)

Automate threading operations (or all?) to automatically return after the
target step has been reached and a key is pressed

Investigate RPM stopping above a certain rotational speed (maybe need
to revisit gearing of rotary encoder)

Rotary encoder doesn't currently do anything with rotation direction,
so getPositionDegrees() fails to take into account manual back-rotation
of the chuck/spindle

Consider adding support for some form of switch / sensor to prevent
carriage movement outside of specific points (or mandate position
checks at start-up to do this in software onlu?)
