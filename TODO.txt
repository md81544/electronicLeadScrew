Storing X-axis positions?

Need to be able to enter a negative angle for tapering (think boring
an internal morse taper, for example)

Check whether backlash compensation will interfere with threading -
it's conceivable the extra steps might throw off the start at
zero degrees?

Threading mode in SFML

Automate threading operations (or all?) to automatically return after the
target step has been reached and a key is pressed

Investigate RPM stopping above a certain rotational speed (maybe need
to revisit gearing of rotary encoder)

Rotary encoder doesn't currently do anything with rotation direction,
so getPositionDegrees() fails to take into account manual back-rotation
of the chuck/spindle

Consider adding support for some form of switch / sensor to prevent
carriage movement outside of specific points (or mandate position
checks at start-up to do this in software only?)
