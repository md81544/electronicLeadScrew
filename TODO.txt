Need to implement code to deal with backlash in
    (a) stepper motor code
    (b) the controller needs to ensure we start in at known position w.r.t.
        backlash - by moving the motor back by the number of steps backlash
        is determined to be, then setting the backlash compensation number for
        that motor

Threading mode in SFML

Setup mode

Automate threading operations (or all?) to automatically return after the
target step has been reached and a key is pressed

Investigate RPM stopping above a certain rotational speed (maybe need
to revisit gearing of rotary encoder)

Rotary encoder doesn't currently do anything with rotation direction,
so getPositionDegrees() fails to take into account manual back-rotation
of the chuck/spindle

Consider adding support for some form of switch / sensor to prevent
carriage movement outside of specific points (or mandate position
checks at start-up to do this in software onlu?)
