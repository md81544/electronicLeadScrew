Read thread pitch data from config file

Remove all unicorn initialisation

Just have two "main" memories for target and return with hotkeys which
just go to these two ('C'ut and 'R'eturn, perhaps?)

Automate threading operations (or all?) to automatically return after the
target step has been reached and a key is pressed

Investigate RPM stopping above a certain rotational speed (maybe need
to revisit gearing of rotary encoder)

Rotary encoder doesn't currently do anything with rotation direction,
so getPositionDegrees() fails to take into account manual back-rotation
of the chuck/spindle

Split UI into model and view components now it's getting more complex
to allow easier migration to a graphic UI in future (perhaps)
